## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

**Design with Flexbox:** I learned how to use Flexbox to simplify the process of aligning and distributing elements within a container, making the design more fluid and flexible.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on the following areas to further enhance my skills:

- **Learning CSS Grid:** I would like to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid to create more complex and adaptable layouts. Grid offers powerful features for building two-dimensional layouts and can complement my existing knowledge of Flexbox.

- **Further Practicing Flexbox:** While I have gained experience with Flexbox, I aim to continue practicing and mastering its advanced features to improve my ability to design flexible and responsive layouts.

- **Exploring New CSS Properties:** I am interested in learning and applying new CSS properties and techniques to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of my designs.
